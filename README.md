# Post Stream

Post Stream is a modern micro-blogging app inspired by Twitter, built with React and Back4App. Share short posts, follow users, and explore trending content in a clean, responsive interface.

This project was developed as a class project for [CSE 40693 - Modern Web Development](https://www.coursicle.com/nd/courses/CSE/40693/) at Notre Dame.

> **Note:** This repository follows instructions and requirements from the course instructor. Naming conventions and some code styles are therefore opinionated and may differ from typical production code.
